# hive_arbitrage
This is a small arbitrage bot working on the hive blockchain. Note: This bot will only work when you provide a working account with a postingkey and activekey.
# scope of the project
This is a proof of concept. This bot was initially given 10 Hive (~2 USD at the time) on 11 August 2024 to start out and reached 110 Hive, which means 100 Hive (~20 USD) in profit, on 22 August 2024. While it does work and there is a small amount of profit, it requires a (in comparison) significant initial one-time investment to cover the ongoing rc-costs (gas fees in hive). Also it needs to be stated that there is no exponential scaling involved or an increase in profit by providing more liquidity. This bot already covers all arbitrage opportunities.
